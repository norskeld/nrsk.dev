- [x] Ships _only ~500 bytes (gzipped)_ of vanilla JavaScript for theme switching.
- [x] Uses **[Tailwind]** for styling.
- [x] Uses good old Markdown with YAML frontmatter for authoring articles.
- [x] Uses **[Shiki]** via **[@nrsk/shikigami]** (with [custom theme][custom-theme]) for syntax highlighting.

Also, well, not a feature, but... **100/100 on [yellowlab.tools]** and **all 100s on [pagespeed.web.dev]**.

## Acknowledgements
